# Poster Brief

Make me a 40x30 inch landscape academic research poster. Cornell CS class project. Clean, modern, top-conference quality. Cornell red (#B31B1B) accent.

## The course

This is for CS 5220: Applied High-Performance and Parallel Computing at Cornell University, taught by Professor Giulia Guidi, Spring 2026. The course covers single-processor optimization, OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, Cerebras CSL, roofline analysis, and GPU programming. The final project is 30% of the grade (proposal 5%, poster 5%, final report 20%).

Every project must incorporate three elements:
1. Parallel programming (hands-on, central to the project)
2. Performance optimization (SIMD, cache-friendly layouts, memory access tuning, arithmetic intensity)
3. Performance analysis (scaling plots, runtime breakdowns, roofline analysis, communication modeling)

The final report is evaluated on: (1) practical content, implementation and tuning effort, (2) experimental data and scaling/performance analysis, (3) theoretical content and creativity, (4) impact and timeliness. The majority of the report should focus on parallelism, not problem description.

The poster session is a checkpoint. Professor Guidi's guidance for the poster:
- ~25% introduction and background
- ~50% what you have accomplished so far
- ~25% future work (what you plan to do between poster session and final report deadline)
- "A poster that's 1/2 or 2/3 problem introduction isn't a good poster"
- Less text is preferred; figures and tables dominate

Poster specs: 40x30 inches (landscape), glossy paper, PDF format. Printed at Mann Library on the CS 5220 department account.

This is a solo project (approved by the instructor). I am building on my own research as a co-author on the STAR-LDM paper.

## What this project is

I'm a co-author on STAR-LDM (COLM 2025), a language model that uses 50 steps of latent diffusion to plan what to say before generating text autoregressively with GPT-2 Large. It produces much better text (MAUVE 94.6 vs 85.2 for GPT-2 Large) but is slow because each diffusion step runs the full 770M-parameter GPT-2 backbone. My CS 5220 (parallel computing) project optimizes this inference pipeline using profiling, roofline analysis, custom Metal GPU kernels for Apple Silicon, and structural code changes.

## IMPORTANT: The intro/background section of the poster should make STAR-LDM crystal clear

The poster audience is CS graduate students who understand transformers and GPT but have never heard of STAR-LDM or diffusion-based language models. The background section needs to answer:

1. What is wrong with standard autoregressive generation?
2. What does STAR-LDM do differently?
3. Why does this produce better text?
4. Why is it slow?

### The problem with standard autoregressive models

Standard language models like GPT-2 generate text left-to-right, one token at a time. Each token is committed immediately with no ability to revise, reconsider, or plan ahead. The model has no concept of where the sentence is going. It is like writing an essay one word at a time without ever thinking about the paragraph structure first.

This leads to problems with coherence, especially over longer passages. The model might start a sentence in one direction and end up somewhere inconsistent because it never planned the whole thought.

### What STAR-LDM does differently: "Think before you speak"

STAR-LDM adds a planning phase before generation. The key idea: before committing to any tokens, the model first figures out the semantic meaning of what it wants to say by iteratively refining a continuous "thought vector" (a 768-dimensional embedding in the space of Sentence-T5, a sentence-level encoder).

This planning uses diffusion, the same technique behind image generators like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion, but applied to sentence-level meaning rather than pixels.

### A concrete example of how decoding works

Suppose the input prefix is: "The discovery of penicillin"

**Step 1 Stop:** The model encodes this prefix through GPT-2 Large, caching the internal key-value representations for later reuse.

**Step 2 Think (50 rounds of planning):**
- Start with pure random noise z_50 in 768 dimensions (no meaning yet)
- Round 50: The noisy vector is reshaped into 8 "soft prompt" tokens and fed through GPT-2 alongside the prefix. The model's prediction is used to slightly denoise the vector. z_50 → z_49. The vector now has a hint of meaning.
- Round 49: Same process. z_49 → z_48. The meaning becomes slightly clearer.
- ... (48 more rounds) ...
- Round 1: z_1 → z_0. The vector now represents a clear semantic plan, like "describe how Fleming's accidental observation led to the development of antibiotics and revolutionized medicine."

The crucial point: at each of these 50 rounds, the FULL GPT-2 Large model (36 layers, 770M parameters) is invoked on the 8 soft-prompt tokens. This is what makes it slow.

**Step 3 AutoRegress:** The final plan z_0 is converted into 8 soft-prompt tokens one last time, prepended to the prefix, and GPT-2 generates the actual text token by token: "...revolutionized modern medicine. Alexander Fleming's serendipitous observation of mold inhibiting bacterial growth in 1928..."

The text is more coherent and purposeful than what GPT-2 would produce without planning because the model knew where the sentence was heading before it started writing.

### Why it produces better text (the quality gap)

| Model | Parameters | MAUVE Score |
|---|---|---|
| GPT-2 Large | 770M | 85.2 |
| GPT-2 XL | 1.5B | 86.6 |
| Pythia 1.4B | 1.4B | 84.8 |
| **STAR-LDM** | **956M** | **94.6** |

MAUVE measures how similar the distribution of generated text is to the distribution of human-written text. Higher is better, 100 is perfect. STAR-LDM at 956M parameters outperforms GPT-2 XL at 1.5B parameters by 8 points. In blind LLM-as-judge evaluations, STAR-LDM wins 60-70% of head-to-head comparisons against GPT-2 XL on coherence and reasoning.

### Why it is slow (the cost of planning)

Each of the 50 diffusion rounds requires a full forward pass through GPT-2 Large (36 transformer layers, 770M parameters) on the 8 soft-prompt tokens, plus two small 6-layer "micro-transformers" (the Soft Prompt Generator and Score Network Head). Then the final autoregressive generation step runs GPT-2 one more time for token-by-token output.

Total: 50 GPT-2 forwards for planning + 1 GPT-2 forward for generation = 51 invocations of a 770M-parameter model. Without any optimization, this takes about 2.3 seconds on an M4 Max, compared to about 1 second for GPT-2 Large alone. The model is 2.3x slower for text that is substantially better.

The question this project answers: can we close this speed gap through systems optimization?

### The hardware: Apple M4 Max and Metal

All experiments run on an Apple M4 Max with 128GB of unified memory and a 40-core GPU. Unlike NVIDIA GPUs which have separate CPU and GPU memory connected by PCIe, Apple Silicon uses a unified memory architecture where the CPU and GPU share the same physical memory pool with 546 GB/s bandwidth. This eliminates memory transfer costs but introduces different bottleneck characteristics.

Apple's GPU programming framework is Metal Shading Language (analogous to CUDA). PyTorch supports Apple GPUs through the MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) backend. Custom GPU kernels must be written in Metal and dispatched through Objective-C++ glue code using PyTorch's MPS stream API. Unlike CUDA, there is no Triton or CUTLASS equivalent for Metal, so all kernel development is manual.

Key hardware specs:
- GPU: 40 cores, ~14 TFLOPS FP32 peak compute
- Memory: 128 GB unified (shared between CPU and GPU)
- Memory bandwidth: 546 GB/s
- No PCIe bottleneck (unified memory)
- Kernel development: Metal Shading Language + Objective-C++ dispatch

## The story (high-level narrative for the poster)

We profiled the pipeline and found GPT-2 accounts for 77% of runtime. Digging deeper, we discovered the bottleneck wasn't GPU compute but software framework overhead: HuggingFace issues 6,185 operator dispatches per diffusion step, of which only 432 (7%) do actual math. 93% is bookkeeping: mask construction, cache management, tensor reshaping.

We wrote 6 custom Metal GPU kernels (1,700 lines of code). Only 2 of 6 were faster than PyTorch's defaults. The four that failed teach us where custom GPU kernels cannot help: when dispatch overhead exceeds compute (DDPM step on 9KB tensors), when vendor BLAS is already optimal (fused FFN), and when the crossover point is too narrow (decode-N attention). We also tried Picard iteration to parallelize diffusion steps and torch.compile on MPS, both of which made things worse.

The biggest win came from two structural changes: (1) rewriting the GPT-2 forward pass in 40 lines of plain PyTorch that strip framework abstractions (3.6x faster per call), and (2) KV-cache reuse with pre-allocated buffers that make per-step cost O(1) instead of O(prefix_length).

We evaluated on real C4 validation text across prefix lengths from 16 to 1000 tokens. At 512-token prefixes with 50 diffusion steps, the optimized pipeline achieves 4.93x end-to-end speedup. The speedup grows with prefix length because the baseline cost scales linearly while ours stays flat.

## Architecture details

STAR-LDM (956M params total) follows a Stop-Think-AutoRegress pipeline:

**Stop:** Encode the input prefix through GPT-2 Large. Cache key-value projections.

**Think:** 50-step diffusion loop. Each step:
1. Noised embedding z_t (768-dim) enters the Soft Prompt Generator (SPG)
2. SPG: Linear(768→3072) → reshape to (8, 384) → Linear(384→1024) → 6 transformer layers (dim 1024, 16 heads, non-causal, FiLM time-conditioning) → Linear(1024→1280). Outputs 8 soft prompt tokens in GPT-2's embedding space.
3. The 8 soft prompts go through GPT-2 Large (36 layers, dim 1280, 20 heads, 770M params) attending to the cached prefix KV.
4. GPT-2 hidden states are concatenated with the soft prompts (2560-dim) and fed to the Score Network Head (SNH): Linear(2560→1024) → 6 transformer layers → Linear→reshape→Linear to produce a 768-dim v-prediction.
5. The v-prediction is converted to predicted clean embedding x_0 and noise eps, then a DDPM update produces z_{t-1}.
6. Repeat 50 times.

**AutoRegress:** The final denoised soft prompts condition GPT-2 for token-by-token text generation (32-64 new tokens).

Quality results from the original paper:
| Model | Parameters | MAUVE (higher = better) |
|---|---|---|
| GPT-2 Large | 770M | 85.2 |
| GPT-2 XL | 1.5B | 86.6 |
| Pythia 1.4B | 1.4B | 84.8 |
| **STAR-LDM** | **956M** | **94.6** |

MAUVE measures distributional similarity to human text. STAR-LDM's +8 point gap over GPT-2 XL is substantial.

## All experimental data

All experiments run on Apple M4 Max (40-core GPU, 128 GB unified memory, 546 GB/s bandwidth), PyTorch 2.10, MPS backend.

### 1. Baseline profiling (50 C4 validation prompts, unoptimized, 50 steps)

| Component | Mean (ms) | % of total | Calls per generation |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPT-2 forward (diffusion loop) | 884 | 38.7% | 50 |
| GPT-2 generate (AR decode) | 879 | 38.5% | 1 |
| SoftPromptGenerator | 208 | 9.1% | 51 |
| ScoreNetHead | 211 | 9.2% | 50 |
| DDPM step + noise schedule | 31 | 1.4% | 50 |
| Other (embedding, concat, etc.) | 70 | 3.1% | |
| **Total** | **2,282** | **100%** | |

GPT-2 backbone = 77.2% of total inference time. The micro-transformers (SPG + ScoreNet) = 18.3%. Diffusion arithmetic = 2.1%.

### 2. Operator dispatch analysis (torch.profiler, per v-prediction call)

| Metric | HuggingFace | Streamlined (ours) |
|---|---|---|
| Total ATen dispatches | 6,185 | 432 |
| Useful computation ops | 432 | 432 |
| Framework overhead ops | 5,753 | 0 |
| Average per-dispatch cost | ~3.4 μs | ~3.4 μs |
| Dispatch overhead per call | ~21 ms | ~1.5 ms |

Top framework overhead consumers in HuggingFace:
- view/empty/copy_ (tensor management): 16,090 calls
- addmm (linear projections): 1,440 calls
- where/arange/le (attention mask construction): 806 calls
- scaled_dot_product_attention (with internal overhead): 360 calls

The 432 essential ops: 36 layers x 12 ops each (2 layer norms, QKV projection, attention, output projection, residual, FFN up, GELU, FFN down, residual, plus a few extras).

### 3. Roofline analysis

Hardware: M4 Max 14 TFLOPS FP32 peak, 546 GB/s memory bandwidth, ridge point 25.6 FLOP/byte.

| Operation | Time (μs) | Arith. Intensity (F/B) | Achieved GFLOP/s | Roofline Ceiling GFLOP/s | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RMSNorm+FiLM (JIT) | 27 | 0.74 | 2.1 | 402 | 0.5% |
| RMSNorm+FiLM (Metal) | 13 | 0.74 | 4.5 | 402 | 1.1% |
| Tiny Attention (JIT) | 95 | 2.28 | 3.2 | 1,245 | 0.3% |
| Tiny Attention (Metal) | 40 | 2.28 | 7.4 | 1,245 | 0.6% |
| DDPM Step (JIT) | 41 | 1.25 | 0.4 | 682 | 0.1% |
| GPT-2 decode-8 (KV cached, pfx=64) | 95,560 | 4.00 | 120 | 2,184 | 5.5% |
| SoftPromptGenerator (6 layers) | 2,775 | 4.04 | 440 | 2,206 | 19.9% |

Key finding: micro-transformer operations achieve less than 1% of the roofline ceiling. The standard roofline model predicts they should sustain hundreds of GFLOP/s based on their arithmetic intensity. The gap is dispatch latency: each tensor is so small (8-128 KB) that the fixed cost of launching a GPU kernel exceeds the computation time. We term this the "dispatch-latency-bound" regime a third regime beyond the classical compute-bound and memory-bound categories.

### 4. What we built optimization methods

**Method A: Streamlined GPT-2 Forward Pass**
Replaced HuggingFace's GPT2LMHeadModel.forward() with 40 lines of PyTorch. Directly iterates over transformer blocks: F.layer_norm → F.linear (QKV) → F.scaled_dot_product_attention → F.linear (out proj) → F.layer_norm → F.linear (FFN up) → F.gelu → F.linear (FFN down). No mask construction, no DynamicCache, no tensor format conversions.
- Dispatch reduction: 6,185 → 432 (93%)
- Per-call speedup: 3.6x on the component that is 70% of runtime
- Correctness: max absolute difference vs HuggingFace < 1e-5

**Method B: KV-Cache Amortization with Pre-Allocated Buffers**
The unoptimized pipeline re-processes all prefix tokens at every diffusion step. We compute prefix KV projections once and reuse them. Critical implementation detail: pre-allocate contiguous KV buffers of shape (prefix_len + 8) for each of 36 layers. Write new soft-prompt KV into fixed slots each step. The naive approach using torch.cat allocates 1,800 new tensors per generation (36 layers × 50 steps), causing 10x slowdown on long prefixes due to MPS memory fragmentation.
- Per-step cost: O(1) vs O(prefix_length)
- Memory allocation in diffusion loop: 0 (vs 1,800 per generation)

**Method C: Custom Metal Compute Shaders**
1,700 lines of Metal Shading Language + Objective-C++ dispatch code. Six kernels:

| # | Kernel | Lines | What it fuses | Per-op speedup | End-to-end status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | RMSNorm+FiLM | 278 | L2 norm + scale + gamma + FiLM affine in one threadgroup | 1.69x | Used in production |
| 2 | Tiny 8-token Attention | 270 | QK-norm + 8×8 attention matrix in registers + softmax, no tiling | 2.39x | Used in production |
| 3 | DDPM Denoising Step | 172 | 17 elementwise ops (variance interpolation, log/exp, noise mixing) | 0.35x (slower) | Disabled dispatch > compute on 9KB tensor |
| 4 | Decode-N Attention | 337 | Online softmax streaming for few-query, moderate-KV pattern | 1.97x at S<40, slower above | Not integrated crossover too narrow |
| 5 | Fused FFN | 341 | LayerNorm + GEMM + GELU + GEMM with intermediate in shared memory | 0.01x (127x slower) | Failed can't beat Apple's BLAS |
| 6 | Speculative Verify | 302 | Softmax over 50K vocab + accept/reject for K=4 candidates | 0.13x (slower) | Not used |

All six compile correctly and produce numerically verified results. Two deliver real speedups. Four are informative negative results that demonstrate the boundaries of where GPU kernel fusion helps.

**Method D: Picard Iteration for Parallel Diffusion (failed)**
Following ParaDiGMS (Shih et al., NeurIPS 2023), we implemented fixed-point iteration to parallelize diffusion steps. Instead of sequential z_50 → z_49 → ... → z_0, guess the entire trajectory and refine in parallel. After 20 iterations, cosine similarity to sequential reference reached only 0.78 far from convergence. The denoising function in STAR-LDM (which includes GPT-2 Large) has a much higher Lipschitz constant than the U-Net denoisers Picard iteration was designed for. Not all diffusion models are amenable to parallel sampling.

**Method E: torch.compile on MPS (failed)**
Tested both inductor and aot_eager backends on the GPT-2 forward pass. Both produced 2-3x slowdowns. The MPS backend does not benefit from the graph-level optimizations (kernel fusion, memory planning) that make torch.compile effective on CUDA. The inductor backend warned "Not enough SMs to use max_autotune_gemm mode," applying CUDA-specific heuristics that don't translate to Apple's GPU.

**Method F: Fast AR Generation**
Replaced HuggingFace's .generate() with a custom autoregressive decode loop using the same streamlined forward approach. Manages its own KV-cache incrementally. Includes top-p sampling and repetition penalty. Per-token decode: 11ms vs 22ms with HuggingFace (2x faster).

### 5. Main result: prefix length scaling on real C4 validation text

Evaluated on real documents from the C4 validation split (allenai/c4). 10 C4 documents per prefix length bucket, 3 runs each = 30 measurements per data point. All numbers are mean ± 95% CI.

**20 Diffusion Steps:**

| Prefix (tokens) | Baseline (ms) | Optimized (ms) | Speedup | n |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 898 ± 9 | 740 ± 5 | 1.21x | 30 |
| 64 | 1,102 ± 18 | 776 ± 7 | 1.42x | 30 |
| 128 | 1,464 ± 36 | 831 ± 12 | 1.76x | 30 |
| 256 | 2,161 ± 28 | 888 ± 7 | 2.43x | 30 |
| 512 | 3,428 ± 62 | 1,013 ± 11 | 3.38x | 30 |
| 768 | 5,100 ± 37 | 1,186 ± 6 | 4.30x | 30 |
| 1000 | 6,558 ± 90 | 1,107 ± 20 | 5.92x | 30 |

**50 Diffusion Steps:**

| Prefix (tokens) | Baseline (ms) | Optimized (ms) | Speedup | n |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 1,707 ± 27 | 1,235 ± 16 | 1.38x | 30 |
| 64 | 2,235 ± 34 | 1,227 ± 8 | 1.82x | 30 |
| 128 | 2,876 ± 23 | 1,281 ± 13 | 2.25x | 30 |
| 256 | 4,389 ± 26 | 1,347 ± 10 | 3.26x | 30 |
| 512 | 7,361 ± 27 | 1,492 ± 9 | 4.93x | 30 |
| 768 | 12,595 ± 676 | 2,469 ± 468 | 5.10x | 30 |
| 1000 | 18,355 ± 950 | 4,273 ± 840 | 4.30x | 30 |

Note: at 768 and 1000 tokens with 50 steps, both baseline and optimized show high variance (676-950ms CI) due to MPS memory pressure on some C4 documents. The clean scaling holds through 512 tokens. The headline numbers are up to **5.92x at 20 steps** and **4.93x at 50 steps** (at 512 tokens where results are clean).

The pattern: baseline cost is O(prefix_length × steps) because it re-processes the entire prefix at every step. Optimized cost is approximately O(steps) because we process only 8 tokens per step. The gap grows linearly with prefix length.

### 6. Per-step component breakdown (with all optimizations active)

Measured at prefix=64, 50 iterations each:

| Component | Per-step (ms) | % of step | x50 steps |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPG (6 layers, fused Metal) | 1.95 | 11.2% | 97 ms |
| Fast GPT-2 (36 layers) | 13.26 | 76.7% | 663 ms |
| ScoreNet (6 layers, fused Metal) | 1.73 | 10.0% | 87 ms |
| DDIM step | 0.36 | 2.1% | 18 ms |
| **Total per step** | **17.29** | | **865 ms** |

Inside one GPT-2 layer (prefix=64):
| Op | Time (ms) | % of layer |
|---|---|---|
| SDPA attention | 0.117 | 35.6% |
| FFN (up + GELU + down) | 0.126 | 38.4% |
| QKV projection | 0.039 | 12.0% |
| Output projection | 0.025 | 7.7% |
| LayerNorm x2 | 0.021 | 6.3% |
| **Per layer** | **0.328** | |
| **x36 layers** | **11.8** | |

### 7. Metal kernel microbenchmarks

Tested with correct STAR-LDM dimensions, 100 warmup + 1000 timed iterations:

| Kernel | Dimensions | JIT (ms) | Metal (ms) | Speedup | Invocations/gen |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RMSNorm+FiLM | (1, 8, 1024) | 0.027 | 0.016 | 1.69x | 1,200 |
| Tiny Attention | (1, 16, 8, 64) | 0.099 | 0.042 | 2.39x | 600 |
| DDPM Step | (1, 768) | 0.040 | 0.115 | 0.35x | 49 |
| Decode-N Attn | (1, 20, 8, 64) vs KV S=13 | 0.021 | 0.011 | 1.97x | N/A |
| Fused FFN | (8, 1280→5120→1280) | 0.124 | 15.77 | 0.01x | N/A |
| Spec Verify | K=4, V=50257 | 0.939 | 7.214 | 0.13x | N/A |

Projected savings from the two successful kernels:
- RMSNorm+FiLM: 1,200 calls × (0.027 - 0.016) = 13.2 ms saved per generation
- Tiny Attention: 600 calls × (0.099 - 0.042) = 34.2 ms saved per generation
- Total kernel savings: ~47 ms per generation

### 8. Batch size scaling (50 steps, all optimizations)

| Batch Size | Total (ms) | Per-sample (ms) | Throughput (samples/s) | Scaling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1,339 | 1,339 | 0.75 | 1.00x |
| 2 | 1,926 | 963 | 1.04 | 1.39x |
| 4 | 2,987 | 747 | 1.34 | 1.79x |
| 8 | 5,895 | 737 | 1.36 | 1.82x |

Throughput plateaus at batch 4-8. The GPU saturates on this workload at B=4 on M4 Max.

### 9. Decode-N attention kernel scaling across KV lengths

Custom Metal kernel for GPT-2's "few queries attending to KV cache" pattern:

| KV Length | SDPA (ms) | Metal (ms) | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13 (prefix=5) | 0.021 | 0.011 | 1.97x |
| 40 (prefix=32) | 0.016 | 0.016 | 1.01x |
| 72 (prefix=64) | 0.011 | 0.021 | 0.54x |
| 128 | 0.013 | 0.035 | 0.36x |
| 256 | 0.016 | 0.068 | 0.24x |

The kernel wins at short KV (dispatch overhead of SDPA dominates) but loses at longer KV (Apple's tiled matmul amortizes better). Crossover at ~40 tokens. End-to-end integration showed zero net improvement because Python wrapper overhead consumed the 18ms of per-call savings.

### 10. Picard iteration convergence data

Tested at 20 diffusion steps, measuring embedding cosine similarity to the sequential DDIM reference:

| Picard Iterations | Time (ms) | Cosine Similarity to Sequential |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | 534 | 0.01 |
| 3 | 588 | 0.07 |
| 5 | 692 | 0.06 |
| 10 | 974 | 0.24 |
| 15 | 1,245 | 0.50 |
| 20 | 1,599 | 0.78 |
| Sequential (reference) | 841 | 1.00 |

By the time Picard approaches convergence (~20 iterations), it takes 2x longer than sequential. The denoising function is too nonlinear for efficient fixed-point iteration.

## Future work (for between poster session and final report)

1. **Cross-platform CUDA comparison:** Run identical benchmarks on NVIDIA A100. Does the streamlined forward help on CUDA? Does torch.compile with CUDA Graphs succeed where MPS failed? This isolates which bottlenecks are hardware-specific vs framework-general.

2. **Quality validation:** Generate 5,000 C4 continuations with both pipelines (matching the original paper's eval: 32-token prefixes, 64-token continuations). Compute MAUVE and perplexity to verify optimizations preserve output quality. Critical because our streamlined forward drops causal masking on the 8 soft prompts.

3. **Model scheduling:** Profile v-prediction error at each noise level. At early (high noise) and late (low noise) diffusion steps, GPT-2 may add minimal value. Replace with cheap SPG+ScoreNet-only path (~3ms vs ~12ms per step). Training-free, potential 30-40% further speedup.

4. **Consistency distillation (stretch goal):** Train student score network to predict clean embedding in 1-4 steps instead of 50, following Latent Consistency Models (Luo et al., ICLR 2024). STAR-LDM's 768-dim embedding space is smoother than pixel space. At 4 steps: projected total ~550ms, faster than GPT-2 Large with better quality.

## How each optimization works in detail

### Streamlined GPT-2 forward what exactly changes

The HuggingFace GPT2LMHeadModel.forward() does this per layer:
1. Check if cross-attention is needed (it's not, but the code checks)
2. Build a causal attention mask using arange, le, where 72 dispatches for mask creation alone
3. Check cache type (DynamicCache vs legacy tuple), update cache state
4. Run attention with the constructed mask
5. Various tensor format conversions (view, permute, contiguous)

Our streamlined forward per layer:
1. F.layer_norm(x, weight, bias)
2. F.linear(h, weight.T, bias) QKV projection
3. reshape + transpose for multi-head
4. Write new KV into pre-allocated buffer slots
5. F.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k_buf, v_buf) no mask needed
6. reshape back
7. F.linear(a, weight.T, bias) output projection + residual
8. F.layer_norm second norm
9. F.linear, F.gelu, F.linear FFN
10. residual

That's 12 ops vs ~170 ops in HuggingFace. The math is identical. The difference is purely in framework overhead eliminated.

Why no causal mask: the 8 soft prompt tokens are generated simultaneously by the non-causal SPG transformer. There is no sequential dependency between them. The causal mask in GPT-2 is an architectural artifact of the autoregressive training, not a semantic requirement for the soft prompt processing during diffusion. This needs quality validation (listed as future work).

### KV-cache with pre-allocated buffers why torch.cat was catastrophic

Original approach (naive KV-cache):
```
for step in range(50):
 for layer in range(36):
 k_new = project_key(soft_prompt) # (1, 20, 8, 64)
 k_full = torch.cat([prefix_k, k_new], dim=2) # allocates NEW tensor
 v_full = torch.cat([prefix_v, v_new], dim=2) # allocates NEW tensor
```

This does 36 × 50 = 1,800 tensor allocations per generation. Each allocation at prefix=512 creates a (1, 20, 520, 64) tensor = 2.6MB. Total: 1,800 × 2.6MB = 4.7GB of allocation churn. On MPS, this causes memory fragmentation and GC pauses. At prefix=200, we measured 10x slowdown from allocation alone.

Our approach:
```
# Once before the loop:
for layer in range(36):
 k_buf = torch.empty(1, 20, prefix_len + 8, 64) # pre-allocate
 k_buf[:, :, :prefix_len] = prefix_k # copy prefix once

# In the loop:
for step in range(50):
 for layer in range(36):
 k_new = project_key(soft_prompt)
 k_buf[:, :, prefix_len:] = k_new # write into existing buffer, no allocation
```

Zero allocation in the diffusion loop. The prefix KV is written once. Only the 8 soft-prompt positions are updated each step via in-place slice assignment.

### Metal kernel architecture details

**RMSNorm+FiLM kernel (rmsnorm_film.metal, 116 lines):**
- One threadgroup per (batch, token) pair
- Threads within the threadgroup cooperate on the D=1024 dimension
- Phase 1: parallel reduction to compute L2 norm (using threadgroup shared memory)
- Phase 2: normalize, apply learned gamma, apply FiLM scale and shift
- The FiLM parameters (scale, shift) come from the time-conditioning MLP and are broadcast across all 8 tokens
- Replaces 3-4 separate dispatches (norm, linear for time cond, scale+shift) with 1

**Tiny attention kernel (tiny_attention.metal, 158 lines):**
- One threadgroup per (batch, head) pair 16 heads × batch_size threadgroups
- The entire Q, K, V for 8 tokens × 64 head_dim = 512 floats per matrix
- All fit in threadgroup shared memory (3 × 512 × 4 bytes = 6KB, well within 32KB limit)
- Includes fused QK-normalization (RMSNorm on Q and K before attention)
- Full 8×8 attention matrix computed and stored in shared memory
- Direct softmax (sum all 8 values, no online algorithm needed)
- No tiling, no streaming, no global memory access for intermediate results

**Why the DDPM step kernel fails (ddpm_step.metal, 63 lines):**
- The DDPM update operates on a 768-dim vector: z_{t-1} = f(z_t, eps, noise, alpha2)
- Working set: 3 × 768 × 4 bytes = 9KB input + 768 × 4 bytes output = 12KB total
- This fits entirely in L1 cache
- JIT-scripted PyTorch fuses the elementwise ops and executes them within the MPS runtime without a separate kernel dispatch
- Our Metal kernel adds a dispatch: encode command buffer, bind buffers, set threadgroup size, dispatch, wait. This dispatch cost (~0.075ms) exceeds the compute savings
- Lesson: kernel fusion only helps when dispatch overhead is a significant fraction of compute time. For 12KB tensors, it never is.

**Why the fused FFN kernel fails (fused_ffn.metal, 173 lines):**
- The FFN does two GEMMs: (8, 1280) × (1280, 5120) then (8, 5120) × (5120, 1280)
- The weight matrices are 25MB each way too large for shared memory
- Our kernel loops over the inner dimension sequentially: each thread accumulates one output element by reading 1280 (or 5120) values one at a time
- Apple's BLAS uses tiled matrix multiplication with SIMD matrix operations, memory prefetching, and optimal cache line utilization
- Our naive loop does ~1 useful FLOP per memory read; BLAS does ~16-64 via tiling
- Result: 127x slower. You cannot out-kernel a vendor's optimized BLAS with a naive loop.

## Key insight for the poster

The central finding is a hierarchy of bottlenecks:

1. **Framework dispatch overhead** (solved by streamlined forward): the dominant bottleneck, responsible for 93% of operator dispatches. Eliminated by rewriting 40 lines of PyTorch.

2. **Redundant computation** (solved by KV-cache): the baseline re-processes O(prefix_length) tokens at every step. KV-cache makes it O(1). This is the scaling result.

3. **GPU kernel efficiency** (partially solved by Metal shaders): the micro-transformer ops run at <1% of hardware ceiling due to dispatch latency. Metal kernels help non-GEMM ops (1.7-2.4x) but can't beat BLAS for matrix multiplications.

The surprise is the ordering. We expected #3 to be the main contribution (this is a parallel computing course). Instead, #1 and #2 dominate. The Metal kernels contribute ~47ms out of 2,282ms baseline (2%). But they demonstrate where GPU parallelism helps and where it doesn't, which is the analytical contribution.

For the course: the parallel programming requirement is met by the 1,700 lines of Metal shaders (threadgroup hierarchy, SIMD reductions, shared memory, register-resident computation). The performance optimization is met by the KV-cache buffers and streamlined forward. The performance analysis is met by the roofline analysis, dispatch count profiling, and prefix-length scaling study. The project hits all three required elements even though the parallel programming part turned out to be the least impactful numerically.
